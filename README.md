# Tamagawa-Conjecture
My goal is to give an account of the ideas presented in the proof of the result. In order to do so we need to develop certain tools such as the Ran space, sheaves on the Ran space, Lax prestacks, etc.

The thesis should be organized in the following way:
1. Gentle introduction to the statement of the conjecture in both the arithmetical and geometrical settings.
2. Justify the need to introduce all the machinery that is required. A way to do this is to presented the cohomological reformulation of the problem using Lurie's talk.
3. Preliminaries: \infty-categories, \infty stable categories, prestacks, lax prestacks.
4. Theory of sheaves: Introduce the notion of a theory of sheaves, introduce the required functorialities, justify why we need to use !-pullback.
5. Ran space and its variations and sheaves on Ran.
6. Global duality statement, local duality statement and pointwise local duality statement (maybe not including a proof).
7. Numerical formula.
